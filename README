Elephantoplasty
-----------------------

This is my effort to create an ORM which would take full advantage from
PostgresSQL. It is currently under steady development.

Philosophy
---------------
1. PostgresSQL is great. However portable ORM's use it like SQLite. To use
   all features of Postgres we need to drop portability to weaker engines.
2. Simple things should be simple, complicated things should be possible.
   The ORM should guess all the obvious things, but allow to override them.
3. Where possible use pythonic strategy EAFTP. If database seems to be not
   in sync with ORM try to migrate.

DONE
-----------------
1. Simple tables.
2. Inheritance.
3. Simplest one-to-many
4. EAFTP table creation

TODO
------------------
1. Different relation loading strategies (lazy, joined etc).
2. Many-to-many
3. EAFTP table migration
